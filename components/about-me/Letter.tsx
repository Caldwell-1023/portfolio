          <p>What&apos;s Up Everyone, I&apos;m Ethan Caldwell from Austin, TX.</p>
          <p>So, my story&apos;s kinda wild. Started coding in 2017, got swept up in the blockchain wave around late 2020. I ended up working on a few ambitious NFT projects‚Äîlaunching tokens, designing smart contracts, and watching the numbers skyrocket. The hype was unreal, and at one point, I felt like I was on top of the world.
          </p>
          <p>But then burnout hit me like a runaway train.
          </p>
          <p>I was stuck, spinning my wheels, buried under the weight of deadlines and expectations. So I hit pause, sold most of my stuff, and took off backpacking for almost two years‚ÄîThailand, Vietnam, Japan, Nepal, you name it. I dove into meditation retreats, rituals, plant medicine, you name it‚Äîtrying to piece myself back together and find that spark I&apos;d lost.
          </p>
          <p>Eventually, I realized I still had this passion for building things that change people&apos;s lives. So here I am, stepping back on the scene with a whole new perspective.
          </p>
          <p>Now I‚Äôm back in the game, juggling multiple hats:
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-6">
              <li>Full-Stack Blockchain Developer</li>
              <li>Live Stream Coding (Building in Public)</li>
              <li>UI/UX Designer</li>
              <li>AI Tinkerer & Hacker</li>
              <li>Creative Problem Solver</li>
            </ul>
          <p>My mission is to fuse blockchain, user empathy, and AI-powered solutions into projects that aren&apos;t just technically cutting-edge but also genuinely human-centric. I‚Äôm here to push boundaries‚Äîwhether it‚Äôs the future of Web3, next-gen AI, or whatever else fuels our collective innovation.
          </p>
          <p>Always down to connect with fellow builders, thinkers, and dreamers.
          </p>
          <p>Let&apos;s build the future together.</p>
